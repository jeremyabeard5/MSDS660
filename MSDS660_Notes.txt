MSDS 660 Notes: Statistics
	Week 1
		Null Hypothesis: Currently Accepted idea
		Alternate Hypothesis: Alternate, new idea
		
		Type I error = when true H_0 (Null) is rejected
		Type II error = when false H_0 (null) is not rejected
		
		p > 0.05 = statistical significant
			0.05 was arbitrarily chosen
		
		HW Assignment: 
			Find something that seems interesting and pick two or three variables that might be correlated
			Interesting topic from WVS: 
			Two or three variables:
			Hypothesis:
			Exploratory Analysis
			Plots, w/ labeled axes and title
			Brief explanation
			Interpretation of results
			
			
	Week 7: Nonparametric statistics
		Sign Test (test for a population median)
			Gives inference about population median, while t-test gives inference about a population mean
		
		Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test (Compare two populations: paired difference)
			Requires symmetric distribution
			suitable when data is measured as a pair (before after score, for example)
		
		Mann-Whitney U-Test (compare distribution of two independent samples)
			Inference for two independent samples
			Populations compared are assumed to have same shape and spread
			ex. comparing sale performance of Team A and Team B 
		
		Kruskal-Wallis Test (compare three or more populations)
			3+ independent samples
			required that k samples are random and independent, samples come from continuous probability distribution. 
			each sample should have at least 5 measurements
			
		Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) Test
			single sample and two independent samples
			distribution-free
		
		Anderson-Darling Test
			Measures how well data follows a specific distribution
			more sensitive than K-S test
		
		Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient
			measures corerlation between 2 ranked variables
			requires that 2 variables are randomly sel;ectged and probability distribtiion of both are vcontginuoius
