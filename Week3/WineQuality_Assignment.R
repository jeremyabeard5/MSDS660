##### Wine Quality In Class Assignment ##### 

### Loading Data ### 
# Load datatable, corrplot, MASS, dplyr, and car libraries


# Load data (pick either white or red wine)


# Change data to datatable or dataframe 


### Exploratory ### 
# Look at summary to see if there are any NAs or characters in the dataset. 
  # If there are NAs and/or characters remove them.


## Plot ## 
# We want to predict wine quality. Plot a histogram and box plot of Quality to look for outliers.
  # If there are any outliers in quality comment on them and discuss how you will deal with outliers


# Plot all the data to look for correlations


# Plot a correlation matrix


### Linear Model ###
# Fit linear model to quality and all variables


## Check Assumptions ## 
# View the summary, VIF, and residual plots of the fit


## Modifying Data ## 
# Are there any variables or observations you want to combine or remove based on VIF, p-value, and corrplot?
  # If so adjust the variables and create a new model and view the summary, VIF, and residuals plots.



## AIC Plots ## 
# Use step AIC to see if there are any variables to remove and create a new model and view the summary, VIF, and residuals plots (if necessary).


# View the AIC score of all the models



### Discussion 
# Post your R file to the discussion board and write a brief summary that includes:
# Which wine data you used. An interpretation of the model and which variable is most positively 
# correlated to quality and which variable is most negatively correlated with quality. 
# Which variables (if any) did you remove or combine. 
# Why (if applicable) did you remove/combine the variables.
# Also, post your final AIC and adjusted R^2 value.
