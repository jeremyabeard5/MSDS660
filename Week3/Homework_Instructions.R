# Pick a dataset of your choosing that is appropriate for MLR. (Should be numerical and not have a lot of missing values). Make sure to comment in your report where you downloaded the dataset.
# 
# Objective: Find the best multilinear regression model of the dataset of your choosing.  
# 
# You must include:
#   1. Box plot and histogram of the dependent variable
# 2. A correlation plot of all the numerical variables
# 3. A MLR model that has a summary, residual plots, and a VIF analysis
# 4. Comment in the R code a justification on why you removed, combined, or left all variables/observations.
# 5. Kudos bonus if you create dummy variables from character values.
# 6. a stepAIC analysis
# 7. Summary, residual plots, and a VIF analysis of the final best model you created.
# 8. AIC scores of all models built
