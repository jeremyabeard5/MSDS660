# Week 1 - Homework Assignment
# Jeremy Beard
# To start, I will list what variables I will focus on for the assignment
# I want to see what
# V10: happiness
# V25: 1st priority for children to learn
# V66: feeling of control over life
# V72: work vs. leisure scale
# V227: income
# V228: tv
# V10 Taking all things together, would you say you are:
# 1 Very happy
# 2 Quite happy
# 3 Not very happy
# 4 Not at all happy
# 9 Don't know
# V25 Here is a shorter list of things that children can be encouraged to learn. If you had
# to choose, which one of these do you consider to be the most important thing for a child
# to learn at home?
# 1=Thrift, saving money and things
# 2=Obedience
# 3=Determination, perseverence
# 4=Religious faith
# 9=Don't know
# V66. Some people feel they have completely free choice and control over their lives,
# while other people feel that what they do has no real effect on what happens to them.
# Please use this scale where 1 means "none at all" and 10 means "a great deal" to indicate
# how much freedom of choice and control you feel you have over the way your life turns
# out.
# 1=None at all, 10=A great deal
# V72. Which point on this scale most clearly describes how much weight you place on
# work (including housework and school work), as compared with leisure or recreation?
# 1. It's leisure that makes life worth living, not work
# 2.
# 3.
# 4.
# 5. Work is what makes life worth living, not leisure
# 9. DK
# V227 Here is a scale of incomes. We would like to know in what group your household
# is, counting all wages, salaries, pensions and other incomes that come in. Just give
# the letter of the group your household falls into, before taxes and other deductions.
# 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# C D E F G H I J K L
# No answer = 98
# [CODE INCOME CATEGORIES BY DECILES FOR YOUR SOCIETY,
# 1=LOWEST DECILE, 10=HIGHEST DECILE]
##### HYPOTHESIS
# 1. A person who prioritizes thrift/saving money more will have a higher income
# 2. A person who feels they have more control over their life has a higher income
# 3. A person who prioritizes work more has a higher income
##### Setup, Reading data
setwd("C:\\Users\\jerem\\OneDrive\\Documents\\School\\_REGIS\\2022-05_Summer\\MSDS660\\Week1") #this will change in your environment
# read in our .rdata file
load("WorldValues_Data.rdata")
# load necessary packages
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
# this converts to a data.table, which is easier
# to work with than other formats in R
